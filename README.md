# 4 Chan Webscraper, Version 2

Consider doing your own data analysis. If you save your CSV, and make a pull request, I can add it to this repository for plotting word usage changes over time.

**Highlights:**

- Written in R.
- Objective: Datamining text, and displaying word frequencies.
- Uses the following libraries: rvest, tidyverse, tidytext, ggplot2, wordcloud.
- If you don't have these installed in your RStudio software, then install them.
- After installing, and running this script into your RStudio IDE, you can download all posts.
- Downloaded posts are then manipulated to show word frequencies.
- Differs from V1 by scraping all replies to OP, and has a much larger noise filter.
